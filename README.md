Autonomous cars can play a crucial role in optimizing traffic management by leveraging real-time data, predictive analytics, and intelligent routing algorithms. Through communication with other autonomous vehicles and traffic infrastructure, these cars can actively avoid congestion, select the most efficient routes, and coordinate their movements. As a result, they can significantly reduce travel times, alleviate congestion, and contribute to smoother traffic flow.
